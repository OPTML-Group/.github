# Welcome to the OPTML Group's GitHub Repository!

## About Us
**OP**timization and **T**rustworthy **M**achine **L**earning (OPTML) group is an active research group at [Michigan State University](https://www.msu.edu). Our research interests span the areas of machine learning (ML)/ deep learning (DL), optimization, computer vision, security, signal processing and data science, with a focus on developing learning algorithms and theory, as well as robust and explainable artificial intelligence (AI). These research themes provide a solid foundation for reaching the long-term research objective: __Making AI systems scalable and trustworthy__.

As AI moves from the lab into the real world (e.g., autonomous vehicles), ensuring its safety becomes a paramount requirement prior to its deployment. Moreover, as datasets, ML/DL models, and learning tasks become increasingly complex, getting ML/DL to scale calls for new advances in learning algorithm design. More broadly, the study towards robust and scalable AI could make a significant impact on machine learning theories, and induce more promising applications in, e.g., automated ML, meta-learning, privacy and security, hardware design, and big data analysis. We seek a new learning frontier when the current learning algorithms become infeasible, and formalize foundations of secure learning.

**We always look for passionate students to join the team in terms of RA/TA/externship/internship/visiting students** [(more info)](https://www.optml-group.com/vacancies)**!**
